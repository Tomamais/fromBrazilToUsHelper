# fromBrazilToUsHelper
When you move from any latin american country, like Brazil (in my case) to USA, it's a challenge dealing: with imperial units instead of metric units. I built this app to help me to get used to US system, presenting side by side the most common units that a ordinary person needs to use on an ordinary routine. I hope you enjoy it.

This app uses Ionic for some purpose. First, I really like everything that Ionic is based on:

 - Mobile context
 - Javascript
 - AngularJS
 - Cordova
 - And on...

In a way to keep updated about these technologies, I decided to built something cool for my eyes and for my skill. Having said that, let's code!
